If you'd like to add members or create your own family tree, you can do so by doing the following steps:

1. Edit the `Family Tree Ai.pl` file
    - File -> Edit -> Navigate and select the `Family Tree Ai.pl` file
2. Enter a person's name and the gender using either `male(*X*).` or `female(*Y*).`
    - ex: `male(mitchee).`
3. Enter a person's relationship using `parent_of(X, Y)` and / or `married_to(X, Y)`
    - ex: `parent_of(cynthia, mitchee).`
